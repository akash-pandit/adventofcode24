# Advent of Code 2024

My attempt at solving the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges now that I've finished finals and gone on break :)

Implementations will be done in C, mostly because I like the language and want to get better at it, but otherwise because I'm taking data structures and algorithms in C/C++ in Winter 2025 and I want to make my life easier.
